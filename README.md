# Overview

### What is a database?

In computing, a database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage. And to simplify :

-   A colection of data
-   A method for accessing and manipulating data
-   A structured set of computerized data with an accessible interface

### Database vs Database Management System (DBMS)

A database is a logically modeled cluster of information [data] that is typically stored on a computer or other type of hardware that is easily accessible in various ways. A database management system is a computer program or other piece of software that allows one to access, interact with, and manipulate a database.

### SQL vs MySQL

SQL is used for accessing, updating and maintaining data in a database and MySQL is an RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) that allows users to keep the data that exists in a database organized. SQL does not change (much), as it is a language. MySQL updates frequently as it is a piece of software.

In a nutshell, SQL is a language for querying databases and MySQL is an open source database product.

# Creating Databases and Tables

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanangmw/ultimate-mysql/main/asset/img3.png)

to create database use command :

> CREATE DATABASE database_name;

to drop database use command :

> DROP database_name

to use database use command :

> USE database_name

### Tables

A table is a collection of related data held in a table format within a database. It consists of columns and rows. In relational databases, and flat file databases, a table is a set of data elements using a model of vertical columns and horizontal rows, the cell being the unit where a row and column intersect.

A database made up of lots of tables

### Tables Data types

Data types in SQL Server are organized into the following categories:

-   INT
-   STRING
-   DATE  
-   
![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanangmw/ultimate-mysql/main/asset/img6.png)

### Creating Tables

```
CREATE TABLE tablename (
column_name data_type
);
```

example :

```
CREATE TABLE cats
  (
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
  );
```

to check if the table worked :

```
SHOW TABLES;
 
SHOW COLUMNS FROM tablename;
```

to drop tables use command :

> DROP TABLE tablename;

# Inserting Data

The "formula":

> INSERT INTO table_name(column_name) VALUES (data);

you can multiple insert using :

```
INSERT INTO table_name 
            (column_name, column_name) 
VALUES      (value, value), 
            (value, value), 
            (value, value);
```

some tips to insert a string that contains quotations aka  `'`  you can use :

-   Escape the quotes with a backslash:  `"This text has \"quotes\" in it"`  or  `'This text has \'quotes\' in it'`
-   Alternate single and double quotes:  `"This text has 'quotes' in it"`  or  `'This text has "quotes" in it'`

to show warnings :

> SHOW WARNINGS;

### NULL and NOT NULL

NULL doesnt mean zero, but rather a field with no value. you can set tables to reject NULL value with :

```
CREATE TABLE cats2
  (
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    age INT NOT NULL
  );
```

### Default Values

The DEFAULT constraint is used to set a default value for a column. The default value will be added to all new records, if no other value is specified. you can set default values with :

```
CREATE TABLE cats3
  (
    name VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'no name provided',
    age INT DEFAULT 99
  );
```

### Primary Keys

The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table. Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values. A table can have only ONE primary key; and in the table, this primary key can consist of single or multiple columns (fields). you can set primary key with :

```
CREATE TABLE unique_cats
  (
    cat_id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (cat_id)
  );
```

# CRUD Command

CRUD is an acronym that stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. We already learn about create, so we will continue with the rest in this section.

### Read

Simple select statement :

> SELECT * FROM cats;
> 
> -   to select all column in that table, you can also select specifics column by typing the column name in the statement.

### Read - WHERE

The WHERE clause is used to filter records. It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition. example :

> SELECT * FROM cats WHERE age=4;

### Read - aliases

SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name. Aliases are often used to make column names more readable. example :

> SELECT name AS 'cat name', breed AS 'kitty breed' FROM cats;

### Update

The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table. example :

> UPDATE cats SET breed='Shorthair' WHERE breed='Tabby';

### Delete

The DELETE command is used to delete existing records in a table. example :

> DELETE FROM cats WHERE name='Egg';
> 
> -   be aware, if you delete without a where statement, it will delete every data in that table

# The World of String Functions

A file with . sql extension is a Structured Query Language (SQL) file that contains code to work with relational databases. It is used to write SQL statements for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on databases.

### CONCAT

Concat function used to combine data for cleaner ouput / desired information.  `CONCAT(column, 'text', anotherColumn, 'more text')`  example :

```
SELECT
  CONCAT(author_fname, ' ', author_lname)
FROM books;
```

### SUBSTRING

The SUBSTRING function extracts some characters from a string. example :

> SELECT SUBSTRING('Hello World', 1, 4);

it will show the first through fourth words, as in  `hell`

### REPLACE

The REPLACE function replaces all occurrences of a substring within a string, with a new substring. example :

> SELECT REPLACE('cheese bread coffee milk', ' ', ' and ');

it will replace the white space with  `' and '`  and will shows  `cheese and bread and coffee and milk`

### REVERSE

The REVERSE function reverses a string and returns the result. example :

> SELECT REVERSE('Hello World');

it will shows the reversed version of the selected value  `dlroW olleH`

### CHAR LENGTH

The LEN function returns the length of a string. example :

> SELECT CONCAT(author_lname, ' is ', CHAR_LENGTH(author_lname), ' characters long') FROM books;

### UPPER and LOWER

The UPPER function converts a string to upper-case. The LOWER function converts a string to lower-case. example :

```
SELECT CONCAT('MY FAVORITE BOOK IS ', UPPER(title)) FROM books;

SELECT CONCAT('MY FAVORITE BOOK IS ', LOWER(title)) FROM books;
```

# Refining our Selection

### DISTINCT

The SELECT DISTINCT command returns only distinct (different) values in the result set. example :

> SELECT DISTINCT author_lname FROM books;

### Sorting Data with ORDER BY

The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword. example :

```
SELECT released_year FROM books ORDER BY released_year DESC;
 
SELECT released_year FROM books ORDER BY released_year ASC;

SELECT title, author_fname, author_lname FROM books ORDER BY 2;
```

### LIMIT

The SQL LIMIT clause restricts how many rows are returned from a query.

> SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY column DESC LIMIT X;

This is the syntax for ordering a table in descending order and limiting the output of the query. We’ve used an ORDER BY clause to retrieve only the first X records.

If you want to offset the LIMIT clause—change the starting point—you can specify a second parameter. Here is the syntax for an SQL LIMIT query that offsets a query:

> SELECT column_name FROM table_name LIMIT starting_point, rows_to_return;

The starting point is the offset for the query (where your results will start). The “rows_to_return” is how many rows you want your query to retrieve.

### LIKE

The SQL LIKE clause is used to compare a value to similar values using wildcard operators. There are two wildcards used in conjunction with the LIKE operator. You can use two wildcards with LIKE:

-   `%`  - Represents zero, one, or multiple characters
-   `_`  - Represents a single character (MS Access uses a question mark (?) instead)

The following SQL selects all customers with a CustomerName starting with "a":

> SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%';

The following SQL selects all customers with a CustomerName ending with "a":

> SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a';

The following SQL selects all customers with a CustomerName that have "or" in any position:

> SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%';

The following SQL statement selects all customers with a CustomerName that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length:

> SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%';

# The Magic of Aggregate Functions

### COUNT Function

The COUNT function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion. example :

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM books; <-- to count all column

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT author_fname) FROM books; <-- to count unique author_fname

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT author_lname, author_fname) FROM books; <-- to count unique author_lname and author_fname
```

### GROUP BY

The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, it summarizes or aggregates identical data into single rows. example :

> SELECT author_lname, COUNT(*) FROM books GROUP BY author_lname;

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanangmw/ultimate-mysql/main/asset/img8.png)

### MIN and MAX
-   The MIN function returns the smallest value of the selected column.
-   The MAX function returns the largest value of the selected column.

example :

```
SELECT MIN(released_year) FROM books; <-- to show the smallest released_year value

SELECT MAX(pages) FROM books; <-- to show the largest pages value
```

you also use MIN and MAX function to search the data :

```
SELECT * FROM books WHERE pages = (SELECT Min(pages) FROM books); 
 
SELECT title, pages FROM books WHERE pages = (SELECT Max(pages) FROM books); 
```

although you can also use combination of ORDER BY and LIMIT function to get the same result with faster fetch time :

```
SELECT title, pages FROM books ORDER BY pages ASC LIMIT 1;
 
SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY pages DESC LIMIT 1;
```

### SUM Function

The SUM function returns the total sum of a numeric column. Example :

```
SELECT SUM(pages) FROM books;

SELECT author_fname,
       author_lname,
       Sum(released_year)
FROM books
GROUP BY
    author_lname,
    author_fname;
```

### AVG Function

The AVG function returns the average value of a numeric column. Example :

```
SELECT AVG(released_year) FROM books;

SELECT author_fname, author_lname, AVG(pages) FROM books
GROUP BY author_lname, author_fname;
```

# The Power of Logical Operator

In SQL, the comparison operators are useful to compare one expression with another expression using mathematical operators like equal  `=`, greater than  `>`, less than  `<`, greater than or equal to  `>=`, less than or equal to  `<=`, not equal  `<>`, etc. on SQL statements. In SQL, we have a different type of comparison operators available those are :

-   SQL Equal  `=`  Operator
-   SQL Not Equal  `!=`  or  `<>`  Operator
-   SQL Greater Than  `>`  Operator
-   SQL Less Than  `<`  Operator
-   SQL Greater Than or Equal To  `>=`  Operator
-   SQL Less Than or Equal To  `<=`  Operator
-   SQL Not Less Than  `!<`  Operator
-   SQL Not Greater Than  `!>`  Operator

In SQL, logical operators are useful to perform some conditional and comparison checks in SQL statements. In logical operators we have a different type of operators available, those are :
| OPERATOR | DESCRIPTION |
|--|--|
| AND | The AND operator in SQL is used to compare data with more than one condition. If all the conditions return TRUE then only it will display records. |
| OR | The OR operator in SQL is used to compare data with more than one condition. If either of the condition is TRUE it will return data. |
| ALL | The ALL operator in SQL returns true when value matches all values in a single column set of values. It’s like AND operator it will compare the value against all values in column. |
| ANY | The Any operator in SQL returns true when the value matches any value in single column set of values. It’s like an OR operator and it will compare value against any value in the column. |
| LIKE | The LIKE operator in SQL is used to search for character string with the specified pattern using wildcards in a column. |
| IN | The IN operator in SQL is used to search for specified value matches any value in set of multiple values. |
| BETWEEN | The BETWEEN operator in SQL is used to get values within a range. |
| EXISTS | The EXISTS operator in SQL is used to show the result if the subquery returns data. |
| NOT | The NOT operator in SQL is a negate operator that means it will show data for opposite of conditions that we mentioned in SQL statement. |
| SOME | The SOME operator in SQL is used to compare value with a single column set of values returned by subquery. SOME must match at least one value in a subquery and that value must be preceded by comparison operators. |


The case statement in SQL returns a value on a specified condition.

### Database Triggers
A SQL trigger is a database object which fires when an event occurs in a database. We can execute a SQL query that will "do something" in a database when a change occurs on a database table such as a record is inserted or updated or deleted.
